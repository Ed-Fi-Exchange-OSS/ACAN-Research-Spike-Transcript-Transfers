# ACAN-Research-Spike-Transcript-Transfers

The Research Spike was a MSDF-funded project with the goal of streamlining transcript
and college readiness data sharing among LEAs and IHEs. There were two components to
this project. First, we developed a draft transcript JSON standard, including ODS
mapping of the data elements, and a transcript API based on composite technology.
Second, we designed a user experience that supports transcript requestors,
registrars, and transcript recipient user personas.
